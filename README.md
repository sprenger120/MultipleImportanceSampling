## Overview 

This is a ray tracer implementation that uses multiple importance sampling with (BRDF sampling and) light source area sampling done for a seminar in 2018.
The implementation is not physically correct and we had some trouble implementing this stuff so don't take this as a reference for anything. Or do it, I'm not your boss. The last image generated for the presentation can be seen here.
